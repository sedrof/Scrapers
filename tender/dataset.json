The archipelago of over 40 low-lying, limestone islands covers 950 km2 and supports numerous endangered, endemic, or range-restricted species and rare habitats.\n\nPopulation concentration in coastal areas and the location of the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Atlantic hurricane belt makes storm surge a significant hazard (Bray et al. 2019). Hurricane Irma for example led to peak surge of over 6 m (University of the West Indies 2017; Williams et al. 2018), damaging infrastructure and natural capital assets (Government of the Virgin Islands 2017). It is therefore important to understand how nature-based solutions may attenuate storm surge and improve resilience in TCI.\n\nThe 2016 Conflict, Stability & Security Fund (CSSF) funded programme of work, 'Enhancing economic security through environmental resilience' in the UK Overseas Territories (OTs) which aimed to improve long-term economic planning to support growth and development. Embedding the role of the natural environment in economic and spatial planning through existing or new policies or legislation was one element, with the objective to protect and enhance the value of the OTs vital natural environment.\n\nThe suite of projects undertaken mapped and valued the natural assets by integrating satellite data, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and economic assessments of the priority environmental goods and services (derived from natural capital). Relevant to this contract is a GIS-based model that was developed to assess vulnerability to storm surge and flooding events and their impacts on infrastructure and human life in the British Virgin Islands.

The course, through a process of self-reflection exercises, will help guide young people to understand what kind of 'Changemaker' they are. In a similar style to a personality test, a young person working through the course will answer various questions about themselves to land on a 'changemaker identity'.\n\nOur expectation is that video outputs will be hosted on YouTube and embedded into the Youth for Our Planet website, which will signpost to further relevant resources should young people wish to explore the topic further. The videos will involve interactive elements and ask that young people respond in the comments with their own personal reflections.\n\nAll elements of the training course should also be adapted as an offline toolkit in order to open access to the training to communities with limited access to the internet, and to allow structured groups of young people (e.g. scout troops) to undertake the course together under supervision from local staff or youth leaders.",

They are appointed by the client to take the lead in planning, managing, monitoring and coordinating health and safety during the pre-construction phase (design and planning stage) of a project.\n\nPrincipal designers have an important role in influencing how risks to health and safety are managed throughout a project. Design decisions made during the pre-construction phase have a significant influence in ensuring the project is delivered in a way that secures the health and safety of everyone affected by the work.\n\nThis review goes above the evaluation that is required by the Post Implementation Review PIR for CDM which focuses on a response to the original Economic Impact Assessment (EIA) and looks at the structural changes that should have occurred within the industry arising from this new role.\n\nOne of the principal findings of the PIR was that the anticipated cost savings that were expected to arise from the introduction of the PD had yet to materialise. Several speculative reasons for this had been put forward. CD Sector needs to have greater understanding of what is driving behaviours in this area and how the role is functioning at present. This is to provide a basis for effective policy development and inform strategic considerations related to wider industry change associated with the Grenfell fire and the creation of a new Building Safety Regulator (BSR).\n\nThe aim of the project is to enhance CD's understanding of how the PD role is being embedded within construction projects of all sizes.",

These include Seminar led training courses (currently proposed virtually via Videoconference (Zoom) but open to change), videos of mini system tutorials that replicate the user completing a task, recorded videos, engaging written content, system user guides, awareness guides of key changes and frequently asked questions.\n\nThey will need to record attendance and create and share the results of evaluation forms to ensure the training has embedded.\n\nAs some of the projects may launch at the same time, they must have the staffing to be able to run parallel training sessions if the training schedule requires it.",

We require this cohort to become skilled in the basic tools and techniques of LEAN/Six Sigma, combined with the agile project delivery methodology to ensure pragmatic execution of CI projects with an appropriate sense of urgency (e.g. Kanban and/or Scrum). To support the cohort through their first improvement project, we require follow-on coaching throughout the improvement project lifecycle.\n\nThe expected outcome as a result of the training and coaching is that each of the 13 people understand the CI / Agile processes to successfully deliver their follow-on project, resulting in an improvement gain for STFC. If deemed impactful, it will guarantee development of a cohort of CI practitioners year on year. Furthermore, ensuring we gain the buy-in of our senior leaders in this initiative is essential, therefore we additionally require a course that raises awareness of LEAN/ Six Sigma, business agility and Agile (SCRUM/Sprint) delivery methods. The objective being to:\n\n\u2022 create a common understanding and language that we use across STFC when discussing improvements;\n\n\u2022 encourage sponsorship of improvement projects across departments; and\n\n\u2022 the increased likelihood of embedding a culture of CI, empowerment of teams, distributed authority and radical transparency.",

It will achieve this through a better understanding of the current ability of, and challenges faced by, the women's estate and prison health and social care services in delivering high quality care, treatment, and support of women in prison in England. It is a year long Review which is expected to report early 2022.\n\nThe contribution of women in prison and those with lived experience of imprisonment is crucial to ensuring that services are designed to effectively meet their need. Embedding the voice of women in prison into the review programme will allow the views, experiences, and concerns of women in prison to inform the findings and recommendations.\n\nThe main objective of the Lived Experience Service will be to ensure women in prison and those with lived experience of imprisonment are aware of the review programme, understand its aims and objectives and can effectively contribute and shape the plans and development of the programme, findings, and recommendations.\n\nThe Service must be independent from the health and social care service provision in the women's prisons to enable the ability to act as an independent and critical friend.\n\nThe provider will be expected to develop and initiate a schedule of gender specific and trauma responsive engagement activities across the women's estate over the life of the review programme and engage directly with women in prison on site as far as practicable within any security/COVID restraints.\n\nAll women's prisons in England are in scope.\n\nThe National Women's Prisons Review Programme is a scoping programme. The deliverables are being executed in stages. The schedule for each stage is approved by the programme board (National Women's Prisons Review Group) following successful closure of the previous stage. The provider will therefore be expected to provide a flexible service and schedule to support programme delivery and adapt to changing demands and timelines.\n\nThe Contract is anticipated to commence on 1st June 2021 until 30th November 2021 in line with the timeline for the review programme. The Contract may be extended for any period up to a further six months. This is not guaranteed and will be dependent on several factors including whether the review programme itself is extended within the 6-month timescale tolerance.\n\nThe contract value is \u00a340,000.\n\nThis procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.",

Our work is aimed at investors and others who rely on company reports, audit and high-quality risk management.\n\nBackground:\n\nIn 2016 the FRC published a report titled Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards (hereafter the '2016 Report') which sought to address how boards can influence and shape their company's culture, build trust with various stakeholders and deliver sustainable success through culture assessment, measuring and monitoring.\n\nIn 2018 the FRC published the new UK Corporate Governance Code which places a greater emphasis on culture, encouraging companies to develop cultures that promote integrity and openness, that value diversity and are responsive to the views of stakeholders.\n\nPurpose and Scope:\n\nResearch conducted by the FRC for its 2020 Annual Review of Corporate Governance indicated that only about a half of companies provided meaningful commentary on their culture in their most recent annual reports, while many companies made no mention at all of monitoring or assessing their culture. In light of these findings, the purpose of this research project is answer three questions:\n\n1. What externally sourced information, guidance and tools/concepts are boards using to frame and support their companies' internal discussions on culture?\n\n2. How have companies' internal practical approaches to measuring corporate culture, embedding (implementing) culture change, and reviewing the impact of that change evolved in the five years since the FRC's 2016 report?\n\n3. What obstacles do companies encounter in promoting the desired corporate culture and how have they been (or how can they be) addressed?\n\n** This is a summary only, please see the PDF download below for full details **",

This will increase the number of people who are able to sustain long term recovery from dependence by providing individual support and treatment which reduces the harm caused by addiction and dependence.\n\nRecovery will be the primary goal of the service. It is therefore imperative that the service as a whole, as well as individual staff, understands the principals of recovery.\n\nThe service will be for six clients, either male or female aged between 18-65, who have a dual diagnosis and who receive clinical mental health treatment. The service should be staffed, seven days a week, 365 days a year, with two staff on duty at certain times of the day. Single waking night cover should also be provided.
